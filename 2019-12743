User Enumeration leading to Account Takeover.

Product: HumHub Social Network Kit Enterprise v1.3.13 
         (Not tested earlier version and community edition, but it could be affected as well)
Class:   Information Disclosure
Payload: http(s)://{domain}/u/{username}/
Details: Allows remote attacker to find the user accounts existing on the Social Network Kits (including self-hosted one) 
         by a difference in path request messages after the /u/ initial URI substring, aka Response Discrepancy 
         Information Exposure.

         As a result, the attacker is possible to compromise the user accounts by brute-forcing the password 
         with usernames found.
